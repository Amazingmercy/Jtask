This a basic TO-DO List application called JTask.
It allows users to perform CRUD actions on tasks.
It also keeps track of users completed task, you could always update your task based when completed.

I developed this app using Rails and other gems found in the Gemfile.

You can simply use it by creating an account, login and then Enjoy keeping track of your daily, weekly or monthly tasks.
